             iSober is designed to help you stay buzzed.  We're are certainly not about
             letting you know when you're safe to drive.  You are never safe to drive.
             Ever.
           </p>
           <p>
             Each time you have a drink, click on the appropriate drink.  If one of the
             listed drinks isn't right for you, click other, and we'll help you calculate
             the right amount.  Then it'll count down until you reach the appropriate
             level of intoxication.  Just because it says you're "sober" doesn't mean there
             is no alcohol in your system.  Just because it says you're "sober" doesn't mean
             you should drive.  What it does mean, is that it's time for another drink!

           <p style="font-style: italic;">It would be extremely foolish for us to pretend that our "iSober" can tell you what your BAC actually is.  It would open us up to an incredible amount of potential liability</p>
           <p style="font-style: italic;">A person's actual BAC is dependent on many complex factors, including their physical condition (body composition, health etc...) and what they have recently ingested (including food, water, medications and other drugs).</p>
           <p style="font-style: italic;">The results that are generated are rough estimates of an average healthy person's BAC assuming typical beverage sizes, recipes and alcohol content. The BAC estimates should not be used to infer anyone's fitness to work, drive or perform any other task or duty.</p>
